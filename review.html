<p>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</p> 

The layout of all my pages are similar. I have a navigation bar at the top of each page with the list of index, QA1.1 - QA1.4, QA1.5 - QA1.8, QA2.1 - QA2.5, QA3.1 - QA3.4, Review and a reference page  

<p>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</p>  
    
    <p>assume It’s Protected as a general rule, it is wise to operate under the assumption that all works are protected by either copyright or trademark law unless conclusive information indicates otherwise. A work is not in the public domain simply because it has been posted on the Internet or because it lacks a copyright notice
    
    Read Click-Wrap Agreements do not assume that clip art, shareware, freeware, or materials labeled “royalty-free” or “copyright-free” can be distributed or copied without authorization. Read the terms and conditions in any “Click to Accept” agreements (often called click-wrap agreements) or “Read Me” files ordinarily accompanying such materials to be certain that your intended use is permitted.
    
    Remove Unauthorized Material If someone complains about an unauthorized use on your website, remove the offending material immediately. In the case of unauthorized uploads, downloads, or links, the webmaster should disable access to the offending material or link. This is not to imply that you should cave in to every complaint. However, you should remove the material for the period during which you investigate the claim. Continuing to use the offensive material after being notified may aggravate the claim and the chances of your being found liable—and increase the amount of damages you may have to pay. Removal of infringing material is also an element of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a 1998 law establishing that an Internet Service Provider can avoid liability by following certain rules, including speedy removal of infringing material. You can read a summary of the DMCA on the U.S. Copyright Office website, at www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf.

    <p>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them  
    </p>
    <p>There are man types of disabilities such as hearing visiual or physical disabilitiesthat can limit people from using and accessing websites. There are many tools to use to help improve experiences for people with disabilities such as Alternative keyoards that can be software or hardware that allow people with physical difficulties to make there own keystrokes that suit them.
        Braille and refreshable braille is a technique involving six to eight dots that are raised in different patterns to represent letters and numbers so that they may be read by people who are blind using their fingertips. Braille systems vary greatly around the world. Some "grades" of braille include additional codes beyond standard alpha-numeric characters, to represent common letter groupings (e.g., "th," "ble" in Grade II American English braille) to make braille more compact.
        Screen magnifier software which is used primarily by individuals with low vision that magnifies a portion of the screen for easier viewing.
        Screen readers which is a software used by individuals who are blind or have learning disabilities that interprets what is displayed on a screen, and directs it either to speech synthesis, for audio output, or refreshable braille, for tactile output.
        Sound notification which is a feature of some operating systems that allow deaf or hard of hearing users to receive visual notification that a warning or error sound has been emitted by the computer.
        Scanning software is used by individuals with some physical or cognitive disabilities that highlights or announces selection choices (e.g., menu items, groups of possible phrases, etc.) one at a time. A user selects a desired item by hitting a switch when the desired item is highlighted or announced.
        Voice recognition is used by people with some physical disabilities or temporary injuries to hands and forearms -- as well as some users interested in greater convenience, and as an input method in some voice browsers. Applications that have full keyboard support can be used with voice recognition.

    <p>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate ﬁletypes for websites</p> 
    
    <p>There are many different types of file formats. Each format represents a particular way of storing the data that makes up a file. Some types of media can be found in many different formats. For example, an image can be stored as a PNG or as a JPEG (as well as many other formats). 
        All images are made up from either raster or vector file types. Raster images are built through a series of pixels, whereas vector files are built using proportional formulas. Every photograph you see on any website will be a raster image and will be saved as either a JPEG, PNG or GIF. Vector images, on the other hand, are more complex and are typically saved as an SVG. They differ from raster images as they are not known to work well with photographs, instead they are perfect for graphics that require frequent resizing such as logos.
