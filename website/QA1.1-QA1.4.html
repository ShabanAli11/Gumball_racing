<p>• 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business :-</p
    >

    <p>The purpose of IT in a modern business is to streamline the company depending on the companies needs. “Technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand”[1]. 
    “First and foremost, technology affects a firm’s ability to communicate with customers. In today’s busy business environment, it is necessary for employees to interact with clients quickly and clearly. Websites allow customers to find answers to their questions after hours. Fast shipment options allow businesses to move products over a large geographic area. When customers use technology to interact with a business, the business benefits because better communication creates a stronger public image”[1]. 
    There is much more I can talk about in regards to the efficiency of operations and how it affects business culture and business relations in regards to communication and security but as I have stated earlier the purpose of IT is to allow companies to collect store and change data and having an IT system in place streamlines this process to save money time and be competitive and effective in any industry in today's modern businesses.

    <p>• 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </p>
        	
<p>“Digital projects from my understanding involve the changing of objects such as a textbook or a painted image, into a digital format for "specialised, enhanced, or remote analysis.[2] "
        "A digital project comprises the planning, preparation, and production that goes into creating electronic publications. Possible electronic publications includes websites, electronic books, digital images, etc.[2]"
        “The power of digital enables us to create virtual models of the physical environment rapidly, so that we can share and collaborate on our ideas and concepts long before ever making them physical[3].”
        “The following is a list of the basic equipment that is needed to work on a digital project. material to encode (i.e. books and images), a computer with a text editor such as Microsoft's visual code or notepad++ and software to process the encoding such as OBS or VMix Live production software [2]”. This can be expanded on to include whatever else is needed for the project in hand and the skills required for the project are copywriting and editing as almost every marketing job requires writing and editing skills in today’s “content is king” environment, and digital project managers are no exception [4]. Problem-solving is a key part of a project managers everyday activities [4]. HTML/CSS are the two languages of the internet. The ability to write in HTML allows project managers to help designers or developers on projects to help meet demands [4]. Social Media as digital project managers, specifically, need to understand the content limitations of each social media platform and how to use social media tools such as publishing platforms like Hootsuite and analytics platforms like Simply Measured [4]. File transfer protocol or FTP is crucial as an effective project manager to be able to communicate and share files on different platforms such as drop-box [4]. A digital project managers must be able to collect data and interpret it, so being able to make reports based on analytics and a great tool that a project manager can use for this is Google Analytics [4]. Attention to details as the project manager should always have a last look for any obvious and unobvious errors [4].Understanding methodologies such as Agile and Scrum  to better plan your schedule and to put timescales on deadlines for certain parts of the project that needs to be completed, tools like liquid planner and base camp can be used for this and which can also be used to help team building by being able to plan ahead for bonding sessions or group activities [4]. The ability to adapt to change as projects can change on a daily basis for many different reasons such as deadline changes [4]. knowledge about content management systems such as word press, drupal and expression engine which are very similar programs for creating, editing and publishing content for projects [4]. Communication and presentations skills as a project manager needs to be able to inspire his team [4].A project manager must be fiscally responsible and be aware of project costs and estimates [4]. A project manager must be positive about the project to inspire the team and to keep morale up [4]. And finally knowing and understanding the tech jargon will help you to interact with your team and help the project manager to contribute to the discussions [4].

        <p> • 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</p>  

           <p>Using Google and various sites such as hostgator.com, I was able to plan building a website with six steps, these are as follows: -
            The first step is to set a purpose and  goal for your website, in my instance it is to create a website as part of my course work for code nation and the goal is to suitably impress the examiners and get an apprenticeship.
            The second step is to create a content strategy which is to figure out what theme and layout you want your website to have as well as the content. With my own website, I would like a star wars theme, however as I have looked through images on the internet, it has been difficult to find a suitable background, but has also inspired to find different images and files such as .gif files and short videos which can be implanted with CSS. I have now gathers a larger library of  short videos and background images that I can decide to use.
            The third step is how you will structure your website which is to decide on what you want on your pages such as the standard sites have an about page and contact page, so your site should meet business needs. With my website navigation will be based around my questions and answers.
            The fourth step is to create a mock-up of your web page (this is also known as a wireframe) it does not need to be detailed it just has to give an idea of what the site will look like.
            The fifth step is to start the final design of the website which will include navigation, easy to read font,  making sure your site fits the screen. keeping your website effectively reduces loading times. making my logos and taglines effective and standalone.
            And the sixth and final step is to test the website for any bugs and to test different web browsers to ensure it works as you want it to.

            <p>• 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</p>  

                <p>There are many reasons an IT project could fail some of them are due to poor preparations and planning at the beginning of the project which could lead to misaligned ideas and people often doing the same work rather than the work that was required. Another  reason towards failure is cost management, as a project may go over your predicted cost due to buying software licenses and this could end up stopping the project. A project manager  may fail to communicate adequately with his team which will lead to breakdowns in communication and the effectiveness of your team. Inexperience and poor leadership by a project manager can lead to bad morale or people even going over the project managers head to complain to higher management. Failure to define parameters between Project manager and team member, as  being able to have a rapport with team members and also have the best work from them is a skill however If and when tasks or goals are not met to standard, there should be ramifications otherwise it could lead to team members not caring about the work they hand in or just not doing it at all [6].
