<p>3.1 Review the beneﬁts and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</p>

    <p> regards to productivity and efficiency it was not the best as I found myself having to search a lot of information on the internet which lead me to other interesting information however this put me back on time in regards to what I wanted to have completed. I could have been more efficient in regards to saving interesting sites to look over later in the day once I had completed my current task. If i was able to do this in a team I would have assigned someone to investigate and research about the project and take down interesting and relevant information and creating a library of pictures/video files and other files like gifs to be used on the website, and someone else to work on the html part of visual code and another to concentrate on CSS, with a individual I.e. myself supervising and helping where needed and coming up with the general layout of the website and structure of it as well.</p>
    
    <p>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</p>
    
    <p>Planning out your day with the help of an organisation tool like Trello and setting alarms to help meet these deadlines would be a massive benefit, for example setting up a card on Trello stating research and information for question 3.2 with notes and information and a time to be completed, with an alarm setup on trello by adding a due date with date and time which will inform the team or the individual (me) that this task has to be completed shortly. In regards to Visual Studio Code having a resource site like stackoverflow.com or w3school.com o a reference device i.e. someones phone or another laptop  so that you can search any complicated html or css script without having to lose your place, however if it was a collaborative project you can then assign different jobs to team members </p>
    
    <p>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</p>  
    
    <p>As someone who has worked as a team leader in different environments, I have a strong focus on teamwork and I believe I would be able to better handle a project like designing a website in a group better than by myself as it would relieve the pressure of having to rush the project and hand in something that you are not entirely happy about. You would be able to focus on parts of the project rather than the whole which can be daunting and lead to sub part work. Being able to focus on part of the project like the HTML code whilst others are working on other research or the CSS code can help speed up where you are and give you more time to customize and try out different ideas. Also using tools like Slack can help as being able to instantly communicate with your team as well as being able to send files and read them on different devices so you can always keep everyone updated is a handy feature and a great tool to use to improve productivity</p>    
    
    <p>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</p>
    
    <p>After using the handiest tool at my disposal (Google) I was able to find a website that broke down testing digital solutions to thirteen points which are: - 
    
    Target market / audience which is when looking at which devices to test against, one must understand what devices the target market is expected to use. Different countries, types of people, including demographics (age brackets) etc will use different devices to get to your site. You must understand where the majority of risk is and look to reduce that risk by testing on the most popular platforms.
    
    Existing breakdown of data / device usage which is to check If your site is already in existence, analytics software, such as Google Analytics, IBM Digital Analytics or Adobe Analytics can be utilised to understand what devices and software are used to access your site.
    
    Check your website to see compatibility on different browsers across different devices, although it is standard behaviour for the user to utilise the browser which is installed with the device, sometimes users will install different software to browse with. Let the previous two points drive your testing on this, but it may also be prudent to install different browsers on your devices and test using those. 
    
    The type of journey a customer takes through your site, when testing a customer journey, it can be useful to break up the flow and try to complete it using different devices. For example, for a reset password journey, you could trigger the password reset from a desktop device, but complete the password reset from a mobile phone.
    
    Test against a ‘base browser’ as different browsers can produce different results when testing. This is then used as the source of truth when it comes to comparing behaviours of the system across different devices.
    
    Are your browsers under Warranty (browsers, versions, operating systems)? Consider what devices, operating systems and browsers are actually under warranty. Often digital companies will state which will be covered under a contract warranty, which makes sense when there are so many browser types, devices and versions out in the marketplace. By only covering what is under warranty, you will not waste time and resources on testing combinations which are not going to be covered.
    
    Often, during the development of a website, error messages, pop ups and pop outs (where a new tab is created within the browser) are used. Development of these for different browsers and screen sizes can sometimes be missed and often bears fruit when testing.
    
    Execute Bug Hunt & Regression Test cycles This is where, as a test team, we run through a number of user journeys across our available devices. We do this methodically, at the same time, to ensure that we can identify issues as you go. Normally, the team would agree on an amount of time to spend on this.
    
    Execute tests on Hardware (where possible) and or software emulators.
    
    Test when device is on different networks (3G, 4G, Wi-Fi).
    
    Stay in touch with market trends (new browsers, new versions, usability stats)
    
    And finally have a final beta test copy you can hand out to a few people to test and get feedback on from an outside source. [9]
