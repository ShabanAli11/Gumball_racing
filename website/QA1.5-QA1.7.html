<p>• 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?  
 
    After researching Google I was able to figure out the best way I would go about selecting the right kind of technology for the job. I found a few sources in regards to this and I would start by making a list of "must have" and "nice to have". you "must have" list should be short and include features that must have in your software and/or software. Your "nice to have" list will cover more programs that are listed by their essentialness to  the project.
    Business technology changes all the time. While it's not always good advice to get the 'next best thing', the well-established trend to 'cloud computing' is something you could consider when making your list. Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet such as infrastructure, platforms and software, and normally includes infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), for example servers for storing files, customer data and email and platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), for example GoogleApp or software-as-a-Service (SaaS), for example accounting platforms like  Xero and Sassu
    When trying to find the best fit for your project, it's important you ask yourself the right questions. Here are a few for you to consider:
    ·Who will be using the computer? 
    ·What will they be using it for? 
    ·How often will it be used?
    ·Where will the computer be used? 
    ·Do you have enough space for a traditional desktop?
    ·Could you consider other options like notebooks, tablets or all-in-ones?
    ·Do you need a single function printer or multifunction printer with colour? 
    ·How will you connect to the printer – do you have access to a Wi-Fi network?
    ·What level of output and speed do you need, and how often do you print?
    ·How much data needs to be stored?
    ·Where will data be accessed, for example locally or remotely? 
     Will your data be accessible during a disaster?
     Have you considered cloud storage instead or as another backup source?
    Clarify your budget To make sure you don’t overspend, set a firm budget and allow for other expenses such as additional software if the software you have does not meet the requirements  for the project. Accessories such as mouse, keyboards, large monitors, screen protectors, ergonomic equipment such as keyboard rests, chairs and leg rests. Father training for the team and project manager if required on unfamiliar software and extended warranties on equipment and  software alike.you can then reduce your options and pick the most suitable and cost effective equipment that you will require and know that you will be able to get anything else at a later date [7].

<p>• 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control: - 

    Trello is an organisation tool as well as a collaboration tool that can be used to display ideas thoughts and to plan a project by yourself and with a team. Trello has helped me to organise my project to become more manageable in the time frame I have been given to complete this project, however it is up to me to keep to it. I have not had the opportunity to use GitHub as of yet so I am unfamiliar with how it helps with code version control however when I searched google it helps organise personal projects from collaborative projects and it keeps all files securely and easily accessible by yourself and others you collaborating with as well as allowing people to add to the codes and make changes if necessary.

<p>• 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?

    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation which came into effect on 25 May 2018. It's used is to improve the privacy of people and give greater control over their personal information and how it is used by organisations such as Amazon, Universal credit and other organisations people/consumers will sign up for a service.
    GDPR can affect digital projects in regards to how they store consumer data which could lead to fines of 4% of the annual turnover or 20million euros, whichever is the larger figure which is the maximum fine  if it has been breached.[5]
