    <H4 style="position: top left;" >My History with IT :-</H4><p> At the age of 10 I got my first my desktop computer which was an advent 800, 
        a month later I had taken apart the computer to see what was inside and was immediately 
        intimidated but adamant that I could put it back together. 
        This unfortunately did not happen and I had to take it back to Dixons (now curries) to be "repaired". 
        This was the beginning of my learning to build computers and use them for different functions.
    </p>
    
     
    <H4 style="position: middle left;">Where I would like to be: -</H4><p>I would love to eventually work as a programmer/coder for preferably at a 
         Gaming Studio like Capital Games which currently have the license for the Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes Mobile 
         app or another subsidiary of E.A that is working on a Star Wars related project as I am through and through 
         a fan of anything Star Wars.</p>
    
        
    <H4 style="position: bottom left;">What I am going to do to achieve this: -</h4><p>Currently I am on a 3 week course with Code Nation (YAY) 
        which has been an excellent introduction to coding. I have learnt how to use the basics of python and now 
        feel confident to work on my own projects and build a portfolio to show my skills and knowledge to companies 
        such as E.A and Capital Games.</p>
