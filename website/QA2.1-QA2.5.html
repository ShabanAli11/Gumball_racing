<p>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello: -  

    As a beginner with basic knowledge of website creation and using an organisation tool 
    Like Trello has been invaluable help as a day to day planner. Being able to look over previous day notes and ideas to help me progress or have better ideas to explore. 
    
    Visual Studio Code is an amazing editor to use as a beginner as the layout is simple and effective for a learner like myself. The layout is intuitive and easily navigable like most Microsoft programs I have used, and being able to implement CSS code as well as other languages in separate pages is in my opinion an amazing feature which has many advantages and makes implementing files and videos to websites easier and neater.
    </p>
    <p>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  

        In my opinion, Visual Studio Code was an excellent tool to use for a first project as the navigation and use of it was easy for me to understand and there is a lot of resources online that I found and was able to implement to make my website plan easier to build and improve. Without using other software out there it is hard to compare VSC to anything else but saying this I think it implements every tool I will need to make my website. Trello is something that I have found helpful to plan my project but I feel that for solo use it is only good for keeping notes on what it was I was doing the day before rather than any help to finishing the project. As someone who has dyslexia I find it easier to write my thoughts down on paper however I can see the benefits to using Trello and I will learn to use it more effectively as I continue learning computing languages.

        <p>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your ﬁnal project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?

            Although i enjoyed working on my website, I would probably stay away from video files as it seems to be alot of work for a small looping graphic. As I didn't have time to make everything work properly, I have been unable to upload a different video for each of my pages and make containers for each.
            At the moment i have a website with a navigation bar and i can successfully navigate between pictures but it seems abit bland to my own sensibilities. I will be working on this site in my own time after I have completed my short course with Code Nation (awesome people)  and I am going to look into a drop down navigation as at the moment my navigation will change colour as you hover over the list and will take you to the page you want to visit, but having it drop down and change between 3 colours rather then 2 would be a interesting challenge. there are many things I could to improve this and critique on but overall I am happy with my site as a firt project.
        </p>
        <p>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project

            I would improve my navigation bar as i said earlier having it drop down and change between 3 colours for when hovering over it and when the link has been clicked or isnt hovered over on would be a interesting challenge as well as different vid files working on each page would be great. Also having a few more pictures and having text wrapped around them. 
        </p>
        <p>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are ﬁt for purpose 

            So i have used MP4s for my background image which due to time I was forced to use the same on each page. The site has a navigation bar which works and I have answered the questions asked of me and have loaded these into the webpage, so in my own opinion I believe I have met the requirements for the project and they are fit for purpose.
